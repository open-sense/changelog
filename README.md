Changelog History of opensense
=============================

The idea is to make them text-friendly, but render them more gracefully in
the GUI.  Why not use GitHub to ship them, huh!

The format is as follows:

* File name is the release name
* "@" line is the date of the annoucement: "Month Day, Year"
* Single line skips are ignored, double line skips are paragraphs
* "o" is transformed into bullet lists, lines with indent are continued
* [x] are links in text in postfix notation, prefix notation is the link
* "--" at the start of the line is a comment and doesn't count as a skip
* "#" at the start of the line displays all line content as is
* Literal text that starts with "http[s]?://" is hyperlinked

We're reinventing the wheel here, but still having fun while doing so.
Plus the scope is really tiny.  ;)
